# Traffic Signal Detection with YOLO    

A Basic Traffic Signal Detection Model Using Pre-trained YOLOv8 Architecture from Ultralytics. The model was trained on 600+ images downloaded from Kaggle. If you plan to train the model with new custom datasets, follow these steps:

1. Replace Images and Labels:
- Replace the existing images and labels in the dataset folder with your custom data.

2. Update the Dataset Configuration:
- Open the *dataset.yaml* file.
- Modify the `path` parameter to point to your root directory where the custom dataset is stored. 

By following these instructions, you can adapt the model to your specific use case. Happy training!
